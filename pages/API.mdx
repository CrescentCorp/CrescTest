All custom types used within CrescTest.

```lua 
function CrescTest.runLune(dir: string, context: any)
```
A bootstrapper intended for usage within lune.

* dir: A path to the folder you want to run all .spec files that are present
* context: any value that you would want all tests to access it
```lua 
function CrescTest.runRoblox(dirInstance: Folder, context: any)
```
A bootstrapper intended for usage within Roblox.

* dirInstace: A folder that contains all the .spec files you need to test.
* context: any value that you would want all tests to access it
```lua 
function CrescTest.runSuite(TestSuite: TestSuite, context: any): TestSuiteResult
```
A runtime-agnostic method for running test suites.

* TestSuite: a table of test cases.
* context: any value that you would want all tests to access it.

```lua 
function CrescTest.expect(input: any)
```
Takes in an input, that then gets used in assertions

* `.never` - Reverses the result of the assertion.
* `.ok()` - Asserts that value is non-nil
* `.equal/equals(expectedValue)` - Asserts that value is equal to expectedValue.
* `.near(value)` - Asserts that the rounded version of input equals the rounded version of value
* `.a(expectedType)` - Asserts that the typeof(input) equals to expectedType.
* `.any.thing.that.is.not.part.of.the.api` - Does nothing, so you are able to write scentences.

x.spec.luau
```
A file that has a bunch of TestCases.
```lua

    end,

        CrescTest.expect(1 - 1).to.equal(0)
    end,
    should_do_something_complex = function(skip)
        --skip()
        task.wait(2)
        CrescTest.expect(1 - 1).to.equal(1)
    end,
    afterAll = function(empty, context)
    end, 
    afterEach = function(empty, context, isSkipped)
    end, 
    beforeAll = function(empty, context)
    end,
    beforeEach = function(empty, context)
    end
