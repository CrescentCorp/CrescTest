# Running Tests

Running tests in CrescTest is a bit complicated than what you normally need
to do with Frameworks like TestEZ.

## Roblox
To run tests in a Roblox environment, we will make use of CrescTest's `.runRoblox` public function, for example:
```Lua
CrescTest.runRoblox(someFolderInReplicatedStorage)
```
This will run all `.spec` ModuleScripts that are located within the said folder,
and then print a result message that contains what files (and their test cases)
were tested, alongside errors that occured (if there is any) during testing.

## Lune
CrescTest also provides a way to run tests within a Lune environment, which is `CrescTest.runLune` 
function, for example:
```Lua
CrescTest.runLune(file_path_to_folder)
```
This will run all `.spec` luau files that are located within the said folder,
and then print a result message that contains what files (and their test cases) that
were tested, alongside errors that occured (if there is any) during testing.

## General

CrescTest also provides a truly runtime-agnostic method for running 
tests, called `.runSuite` public function.
```lua
local result = CrescTest.runSuite({
    case1 = function(skip)
    end
})

print(result) -- {case1 = {ok = true, err = nil}}
```

This function specifically takes a table of test cases, and context (can be nill),
and then it runs all the given tests, and after that it returns a test suite result 
that can be parsed by custom bootstrappers.

    Implementation detail: All built-in bootstrappers
    actively use this method, as such, when writing a custom bootstrapper
    for an environment, you only need to handle the tree resolving
    part of a directory, and rendering the results.
