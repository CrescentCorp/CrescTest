CrescTest is a powerful and runtime-agnostic Luau testing framework for usage with Lune, or Roblox Studio

## Origin
CrescTest isn't the first unit testing framework I wrote. In fact, its a successor to the Unit testing framework that libraries like Vinum and BridgeNet2 use.

CrescTest has been made to improve what the Orginial framework didn't do well, and to provide what it lacked. For example:

* Improved error reporting
* Cross-runtime testing
* Extremely lightweight.
* Ability to skip test cases.
* lifecycle functions.

## Documentation Structure

CrescTest's documentation is based off Roblox's TestEZ documentation structure
